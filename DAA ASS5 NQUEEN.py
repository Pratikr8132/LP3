# Problem Statement:
# The code aims to solve the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle that involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

#
# Certainly, here are the answers to the questions related to the N-Queens Backtracking code:
#
# What problem does this code aim to solve?
#
# This code aims to solve the N-Queens problem.
# What is the N-Queens problem?
#
# The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle that involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other, meaning no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.
# How does the code represent the chessboard?
#
# The chessboard is represented as a 2D array board where '1' represents the presence of a queen, and '0' represents an empty square.
# What does the solveNQUtil method do?
#
# solveNQUtil is a recursive utility function that attempts to place queens on the chessboard safely. It explores possible queen placements by considering constraints such as column, left diagonal, and right diagonal, ensuring queens do not attack each other.
# How does the code check if all queens are placed on the chessboard?
#
# It checks if col (the current column) is greater than or equal to N (the board size) to determine if all queens are placed.
# What is the role of the self.ld array?
#
# self.ld is an array to check if queens can be placed in the left diagonal without attacking each other.
# What is the role of the self.rd array?
#
# self.rd is an array to check if queens can be placed in the right diagonal without attacking each other.
# How is the initial position of the first queen determined?
#
# The initial position of the first queen is provided as input when creating an instance of the NQBacktracking class.
# What is the purpose of the solveNQ method?
#
# The solveNQ method initializes the chessboard, places the initial queen, and calls solveNQUtil to find a solution to the N-Queens problem. It can print the solution or indicate that no solution exists.
# What happens if the code cannot find a solution to the N-Queens problem?
#
# It prints "Solution does not exist" and returns False.
# How does the code ensure queens do not attack each other?
#
# It uses arrays (self.ld, self.rd, and self.cl) to keep track of constraints for safe queen placements, preventing queens from attacking each other.
# Explain the purpose of the printSolution method.
#
# The printSolution method is a utility function to print the chessboard solution, showing the positions of queens and empty squares.
# What is the significance of the main section of the code?
#
# The main section sets the size of the chessboard (N), the initial position of the first queen, creates an instance of the NQBacktracking class, and attempts to solve the N-Queens problem.
# What would be the expected output for the given input values (N=8, x=3, y=2)?
#
# The expected output would be a chessboard showing the placement of queens, with the 1st queen initially placed at row 3, column 2.
# Is this code capable of finding all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem?
#
# No, this code finds one feasible solution. There can be multiple solutions, but this code prints only one of them.
# How would you modify this code to find and print all possible solutions?
#
# To find and print all possible solutions, you could modify the code to continue searching for solutions after finding one. This may involve backtracking and exploring additional placements.
# What is the time complexity of this N-Queens solving algorithm?
#
# The time complexity is typically exponential, but it depends on the specific implementation and pruning techniques used.
# What is the time complexity of the solveNQUtil method?
#
# The time complexity of solveNQUtil is generally O(N^N) in the worst case.
# How does backtracking work in this code?
#
# Backtracking works by trying queen placements, and if a placement leads to a conflict, it reverts the placement (backtracks) and explores other possibilities.
# What does "Solution does not exist" indicate in the output?
#
# It indicates that the code could not find a solution for the given N-Queens problem with the provided initial queen placement.
# What would be the expected output if there is no solution to the N-Queens problem?
#
# The code would print "Solution does not exist" to indicate that no valid solution can be found.
# Why is the size of the chessboard (N) set to 8 in the main section?
#
# N is set to 8 to create an 8x8 chessboard, which is a common size for the N-Queens problem.
# How does the code mark the positions of queens and empty squares on the chessboard?
#
# Queens are marked with '1', and empty squares are marked with '0' in the board array.
# What are the constraints of the N-Queens problem?
#
# The constraints are that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.
# How does the code handle the case when the initial queen is in the same column as the current queen placement?
#
# It skips checking the column where the 1st queen is placed to ensure queens do not interfere with each other.
# Can the code find multiple solutions to the N-Queens problem?
#
# The code is currently designed to find and print one solution. You would need to modify it to find multiple solutions.
# Explain how the code uses arrays self.ld, self.rd, and self.cl to check safety.
#
# self.ld, self.rd, and self.cl arrays are used to mark and check the safety of queen placements. They help ensure that queens do not attack each other in the left diagonal, right diagonal, and columns.
# Why is the solveNQUtil method called for each column?
#
# The method is called for each column because the N-Queens problem is solved row by row, column by column. The solveNQUtil method explores possible queen placements in each column, backtracking as needed.
# How does the code backtrack when it cannot find a solution?
#
# Backtracking is achieved by undoing queen placements (setting the value back to 0) and updating the arrays self.ld, self.rd, and self.cl to allow for further exploration of other queen placements.
# Can you explain the data structures used in the code for solving the N-Queens problem?
#
# The main data structure is a 2D array board, which represents the chessboard and stores queen positions. The code also uses arrays self.ld, self.rd, and self.cl to check safety and constraints for queen placements. Additionally, the NQBacktracking class is used to encapsulate the solution logic and provide utility functions for solving the N-Queens problem.
